	abstract = {We present C and O abundances in the Magellanic Clouds derived from deep spectra of H II regions. The data have been taken with the Ultraviolet-Visual Echelle Spectrograph at the 8.2-m Very Large Telescope. The sample comprises ﬁve H II regions in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and four in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). We measure pure recombination lines (RLs) of C II and O II in all the objects, permitting to derive the abundance discrepancy factors (ADFs) for O2+, as well as their O/H, C/H and C/O ratios. We compare the ADFs with those of other H II regions in different galaxies. The results suggest a possible metallicity dependence of the ADF for the low-metallicity objects; but more uncertain for high-metallicity objects. We compare nebular and B-type stellar abundances and we ﬁnd that the stellar abundances agree better with the nebular ones derived from collisionally excited lines (CELs). Comparing these results with other galaxies we observe that stellar abundances seem to agree better with the nebular ones derived from CELs in low-metallicity environments and from RLs in high-metallicity environments. The C/H, O/H and C/O ratios show almost ﬂat radial gradients, in contrast with the spiral galaxies where such gradients are negative. We explore the chemical evolution analysing C/O versus O/H and comparing with the results of H II regions in other galaxies. The LMC seems to show a similar chemical evolution to the external zones of small spiral galaxies and the SMC behaves as a typical star-forming dwarf galaxy.},

The observations cover the spectral range 3100–10400 Å with a spectral resolution of λ ≥ λ/11600, and we measure 95–225 emission lines in each object. We derive ionic and total abundances of O, N, S, Ne, Ar, Cl, and Fe using collisionally excited lines. We ﬁnd average values of 12 + log (O/H) = 8.37 in the LMC and 8.01 in the SMC, with standard deviations of σ = 0.03 and 0.02 dex, respectively. The S/O, Ne/O, Ar/O, and Cl/O abundance ratios are very similar in both clouds with σ = 0.02–0.03 dex, which indicates that the chemical elements are well mixed in the interstellar medium of each galaxy. The LMC is enhanced in N/O by ∼0.20 dex with respect to the SMC, and the dispersions in N/O, σ = 0.05 dex in each cloud, are larger than those found for the other elements. The derived standard deviations would be much larger for all the abundance ratios, up to 0.20 dex for N/O, if previous spectra of these objects were used to perform the analysis. Finally, we ﬁnd a wide range of iron depletions in both clouds with more than 90 per cent of the iron atoms deposited on to dust grains in most objects.},

	abstract = {Young metal atoms, after they have been violently ejected into the ambient ISM from their dead, massive birth stars, are faced with some options. Some may stay close to home, some may travel within their galaxies, some are taken in by newly forming stars along the way, and others may venture outside of their galaxies altogether. We have been investigating the fates of the metal atoms in galaxies by measuring gas-phase abundances using HII regions in the Magellanic Clouds. We find that the oxygen abundances of their HII regions are significantly lower than what we expect, based on common assumptions about the net oxygen yield from stars, and given their total stellar content. From this oxygen deficiency, we infer that there is a significant loss of metals from the ionized ISM in the Magellanic Clouds. Future research will trace the spread of these missing metals, possibly to other gaseous phases within the galaxies, or within the Milky Way halo. Our findings also lay the groundwork for comparing the metal abundances of the HII regions to those of neutral HI gas along the same lines-of-sight, and testing long-standing assumptions of uniform chemical abundances across gas phases in the ISM.},

	abstract = {Much of what is known of the chemical composition of the universe is based on emission line spectra from star-forming galaxies. Emission-based inferences are, nevertheless, model-dependent and they are dominated by light from luminous star-forming regions. An alternative and sensitive probe of the metallicity of galaxies is through absorption lines imprinted on the luminous afterglow spectra of long gamma ray bursts (GRBs) from neutral material within their host galaxy. We present results from a JWST/NIRSpec programme to investigate for the ﬁrst time the relation between the metallicity of neutral gas probed in absorption by GRB afterglows and the metallicity of the star-forming regions for the same host galaxy sample. Using an initial sample of eight GRB host galaxies at z = 2.1–4.7, we ﬁnd a tight relation between absorption and emission line metallicities when using the recently proposed Rˆ metallicity diagnostic (±0.2 dex). This agreement implies a relatively chemically homogeneous multiphase interstellar medium and indicates that absorption and emission line probes can be directly compared. However, the relation is less clear when using other diagnostics, such as R23 and R3. We also ﬁnd possible evidence of an elevated N/O ratio in the host galaxy of GRB 090323 at z = 4.7, consistent with what has been seen in other z {\textgreater} 4 galaxies. Ultimate conﬁrmation of an enhanced N/O ratio and of the relation between absorption and emission line metallicities will require a more direct determination of the emission line metallicity via the detection of temperature-sensitive auroral lines in our GRB host galaxy sample.},

	abstract = {Methods. We collected literature column densities of Ti II, Ni II, Cr II, Fe II, Mn II, Si II, Cu II, Mg II, S II, P II, Zn II, and O I in the neutral ISM towards 32 hot stars in the LMC and 22 in the SMC. We determined dust depletion from the relative abundances of different metals because they deplete with different strengths. This includes a ‘golden sample’ of sightlines where Ti and other αelements are available. We fit linear relations to the observed abundance patterns so that the slopes determined the strengths of dust depletion and the normalizations determined the metallicities. We investigated α-element enhancements in the gas from the deviations from the linear fits and compared them with stars.
Results. In our golden sample we find α-element enhancement in the neutral ISM in most systems, on average 0.26 dex (0.35 dex) for the LMC (SMC), and an Mn underabundance in the SMC (on average −0.35 dex). Measurements of Mn II are not available for the LMC. These are higher than for stars at similar metallicities. We find total neutral ISM metallicities that are mostly consistent with hot star metallicity values, on average [M/H]tot = −0.33 (−0.83), with standard deviations of 0.30 (0.30), in the LMC (the SMC). In six systems, however, we find significantly lower metallicities, 2 out of 32 in the LMC (with ∼16\% solar) and 4 out of 22 in the SMC (3 and 10\% solar), two of which are in the outskirts of the SMC near the Magellanic Bridge, a region known for having a lower metallicity.
Conclusions. The observed α-element enhancements and Mn underabundance are likely due to bursts of star formation, more recently than ∼1 Gyr ago, that enriched the ISM from core-collapse supernovae. With the exception of lines of sight towards the Magellanic Bridge, the neutral gas in the LMC and SMC appears fairly well mixed in terms of metallicity.},

We collect and compare large samples of depletion measurements in the Milky Way (MW), Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) (Z = 0.5 Z ⊙), and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) (Z = 0.2 Z ⊙). The relations between the depletions of different elements do not strongly vary between the three galaxies, implying that abundance ratios should trace depletions accurately down to 20\% solar metallicity. From the depletions, we derive D/G and D/M. The D/G increases with density, consistent with the more efficient accretion of gas-phase metals onto dust grains in the denser ISM. For log N(H) {\textgreater} 21 cm−2, the depletion of metallicity tracers (S, Zn) exceeds −0.5 dex, even at 20\% solar metallicity. The gas fraction of metals increases from the MW to the LMC (factor 3) and SMC (factor 6), compensating for the reduction in total heavy element abundances and resulting in those three galaxies having the same neutral gas-phase metallicities. The D/G derived from depletions are respective factors of 2 (LMC) and 5 (SMC) higher than the D/G derived from FIR, 21 cm, and CO emission, likely due to the combined uncertainties on the dust FIR opacity and on the depletion of carbon and oxygen.},

	abstract = {A key component of the baryon cycle in galaxies is the depletion of metals from the gas to the dust phase in the neutral interstellar medium (ISM). The METAL (Metal Evolution, Transport, and Abundance in the Large Magellanic Cloud) program on the Hubble Space Telescope acquired UV spectra toward 32 sight lines in the half-solar metallicity LMC, from which we derive interstellar depletions (gas-phase fractions) of Mg, Si, Fe, Ni, S, Zn, Cr, and Cu. The depletions of different elements are tightly correlated, indicating a common origin. Hydrogen column density is the main driver for depletion variations. Correlations are weaker with volume density, probed by C i fine-structure lines, and distance to the LMC center. The latter correlation results from an east–west variation of the gas-phase metallicity. Gas in the east, compressed side of the LMC encompassing 30 Doradus and the southeast H i over-density is enriched by up to +0.3 dex, while gas in the west side is metal deficient by up to −0.5 dex. Within the parameter space probed by METAL, no correlation with molecular fraction or radiation-field intensity are found. We confirm the factor of three to four increase in dust-to-metal and dust-to-gas ratios between the diffuse (log N(H) ∼ 20 cm−2) and molecular (log N(H) ∼ 22 cm−2) ISM observed from far-infrared, 21 cm, and CO observations. The variations of dust-to-metal and dust-to-gas ratios with column density have important implications for the sub-grid physics of chemical evolution, gas and dust mass estimates throughout cosmic times, and for the chemical enrichment of the Universe measured via spectroscopy of damped Lyα systems.},

	abstract = {The cycling of metals between interstellar gas and dust is a critical aspect of the baryon cycle of galaxies, yet our understanding of this process is limited. This study focuses on understanding dust depletion effects in the low-metallicity regime ({\textless}20\% Z ⊙) typical of cosmic noon. Using medium-resolution UV spectroscopy from the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph on board the Hubble Space Telescope, gas-phase abundances and depletions of iron and sulfur were derived toward 18 sight lines in local dwarf galaxies IC 1613 and Sextans A. The results show that the depletion of Fe and S is consistent with that found in the Milky Way (MW), LMC, and SMC. The depletion level of Fe increases with gas column density, indicating dust growth in the interstellar medium. The level of Fe depletion decreases with decreasing metallicity, resulting in the fraction of iron in gas ranging from 3\% in the MW to 9\% in IC 1613 and ∼19\% in Sextans A. The dust-to-gas and dust-to-metal ratios (D/G, D/M) for these dwarf galaxies were estimated based on the MW relations between the depletion of Fe and other elements. The study finds that D/G decreases only slightly sublinearly with metallicity, with D/M decreasing from 0.41 ± 0.05 in the MW to 0.11 ± 0.11 at 0.10 Z ⊙ (at log N(H) = 21 cm−2). The trend of D/G versus metallicity using depletion in local systems is similar to that inferred in Damped Lyα systems from abundance ratios but lies higher than the trend inferred from far-IR measurements in nearby galaxies.},

	abstract = {Metal Evolution, Transport, and Abundance in the LMC (METAL) is a large Cycle 24 program on the Hubble Space Telescope aimed at measuring dust extinction properties and interstellar depletions in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) at half-solar metallicity. The 101-orbit program is composed of Cosmic Origins Spectrograph and Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph spectroscopy toward 33 LMC massive stars between 1150 and 3180 Å and parallel Wide Field Camera 3 imaging in seven near-UV to near-IR filters. The fraction of silicon in the gas phase (depletion) obtained from the spectroscopy decreases with increasing hydrogen column density. Depletion patterns for silicon differ between the Milky Way, LMC, and SMC, with the silicon depletion level offsetting almost exactly the metallicity differences, leading to constant gas-phase abundances in those galaxies for a given hydrogen column density. The silicon depletion correlates linearly with the absolute-to-selective extinction, RV, indicating a link between gas depletion and dust grain size. Extinction maps are derived from the resolved stellar photometry in the parallel imaging, which can be compared to far-IR images from Herschel and Spitzer to estimate the emissivity of dust at LMC metallicity. The full METAL sample of depletions, UV extinction curves, and extinction maps will inform the abundance, size, composition, and optical properties of dust grains in the LMC, comprehensively improve our understanding of dust properties, and improve the accuracy with which dust-based gas masses, star formation rates, and star formation histories in nearby and high-redshift galaxies are estimated.

	abstract = {The evolution of the metal content of the universe can be tracked through rest-frame UV spectroscopy of damped Lyα systems (DLAs). Gas-phase abundances in DLAs must be corrected for dust depletion effects, which can be accomplished by calibrating the relation between abundance ratios such as [Zn/Fe] and depletions (the fraction of metals in gas, as opposed to dust). Using samples of gas-phase abundances and depletions in the Milky Way (MW), LMC, and SMC, we demonstrate that the relation between [Zn/Fe] and other abundance ratios does not change significantly between these local galaxies and DLAs, indicating that [Zn/Fe] should trace depletions of heavy elements in those systems. The availability of photospheric abundances in young massive stars, a proxy for the total (gas+dust) metallicity of neutral gas, in the MW, LMC, and SMC allows us to calibrate the relation between [Zn/Fe] and depletions in these nearby galaxies. We apply the local calibrations of depletions to DLAs. We find that the fraction of metals in dust, the dust-to-gas ratio, and total abundances are 2–5 times lower than inferred from previous depletion calibrations based on MW measurements and a different formalism. However, the trend of dust abundance versus metallicity remains only slightly sublinear for all existing depletion calibrations, contrary to what is inferred from far-IR (FIR), 21 cm, and CO emission in nearby galaxies and predicted by chemical evolution models. Observational constraints on the FIR dust opacity and depletions at metallicities lower than 20\% solar will be needed to resolve this tension.},

	abstract = {The solar chemical composition is an important ingredient in our understanding of the formation, structure, and evolution of both the Sun and our Solar System. Furthermore, it is an essential reference standard against which the elemental contents of other astronomical objects are compared. In this review, we evaluate the current understanding of the solar photospheric composition. In particular, we present a redetermination of the abundances of nearly all available elements, using a realistic new three-dimensional (3D), time-dependent hydrodynamical model of the solar atmosphere. We have carefully considered the atomic input data and selection of spectral lines, and accounted for departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) whenever possible. The end result is a comprehensive and homogeneous compilation of the solar elemental abundances. Particularly noteworthy findings are significantly lower abundances of C, N, O, and Ne compared to the widely used values of a decade ago. The new solar chemical composition is supported by a high degree of internal consistency between available abundance indicators, and by agreement with values obtained in the Solar Neighborhood and from the most pristine meteorites. There is, however, a stark conflict with standard models of the solar interior according to helioseismology, a discrepancy that has yet to find a satisfactory resolution.},

Damped Lyα (DLA) absorption is detected at the redshift of UGC 5282 with log [N(H i) cm. Analysis of the accompanying S ii, P ii, and O i metal lines yields a neutral gas metallicity, , of [S/H] ≃ [P/H] = −0.80 ± 0.24. The metallicity of ionized gas from the central H ii region measured from its emission lines is [O/H] = −0.37 ± 0.10, a difference of +0.43 ± 0.26 from . This difference δ is consistent with that seen toward H ii regions in other star-forming galaxies and supports the idea that ionized gas near star-forming regions shows systematically higher metallicities than exist in the rest of a galaxy’s neutral interstellar medium (ISM). The positive values of δ found in UGC 5282 (and the other star-forming galaxies) is likely due to infalling low-metallicity gas from the intergalactic medium that mixes with the galaxy’s ISM on kiloparsec scales. This model is also consistent with broad Lyα emission detected at the bottom of the DLA absorption, offset by ∼125 km s−1 from the absorption velocity. Models of galaxy evolution that attempt to replicate population characteristics, such as the mass–metallicity relation, may need to start with a galaxy metallicity represented by rather than that measured traditionally from .},

	abstract = {The interstellar medium (ISM) comprises gases at different temperatures and densities, including ionized, atomic and molecular species, and dust particles1. The neutral ISM is dominated by neutral hydrogen2 and has ionization fractions of up to eight per cent3. The concentration of chemical elements heavier than helium (metallicity) spans orders of magnitudes in Galactic stars4, because they formed at different times. However, the gas in the vicinity of the Sun is assumed to be well mixed and to have a solar metallicity in traditional chemical evolution models5. The ISM chemical abundances can be accurately measured with ultraviolet absorption-line spectroscopy. However, the effects of dust depletion6–9—which removes part of the metals from the observable gaseous phase and incorporates it into solid grains—have prevented, until recently, a deeper investigation of the ISM metallicity. Here we report the dust-corrected metallicity of the neutral ISM measured towards 25 stars in our Galaxy. We find large variations in metallicity over a factor of ten (with an average of 55 ± 7 per cent solar metallicity and a standard deviation of 0.28 dex), including many regions of low metallicity, down to about 17 per cent solar metallicity and possibly below. Pristine gas falling onto the Galactic disk in the form of high-velocity clouds can cause the observed chemical inhomogeneities on scales of tens of parsecs. Our results suggest that this low-metallicity accreting gas does not efficiently mix into the ISM, which may help us understand metallicity deviations in nearby coeval stars.},

	abstract = {The abundance of oxygen in galaxies is widely used in furthering our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution. Unfortunately, direct measurements of O/H in the neutral gas are extremely difficult to obtain, as the only O i line available within the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) UV wavelength range (1150–3200 Å) is often saturated. As such, proxies for oxygen are needed to indirectly derive O/H via the assumption that solar ratios based on local Milky Way sight lines hold in different environments. In this paper we assess the validity of using two such proxies, P ii and S ii, within more typical star-forming environments. Using HST-Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) far-UV (FUV) spectra of a sample of nearby star-forming galaxies (SFGs) and the oxygen abundances in their ionized gas, we demonstrate that both P and S are mildly depleted with respect to O and follow a trend, log(P ii/S ii) , in excellent agreement with the solar ratio of over the large range of metallicities (0.03–3.2 Z⊙) and H i column densities ((H i)/cm−2] =18.44–21.28) spanned by the sample. From literature data we show evidence that both elements individually trace oxygen according to their respective solar ratios across a wide range of environments. Our findings demonst-rate that the solar ratios of and can both be used to derive reliable O/H abundances in the neutral gas of local and high-redshift SFGs. The difference between O/H in the ionized- and neutral gas phases is studied with respect to metallicity and H i content. The observed trends are consistent with galactic outflows and/or star formation inefficiency affecting the most metal-poor galaxies, with the possibility of primordial gas accretion at all metallicities.},

	abstract = {A study of gas-phase element abundances reported in the literature for 17 different elements sampled over 243 sight lines in the local part of our Galaxy reveals that the depletions into solid form (dust grains) are extremely well characterized by trends that employ only three kinds of parameters. One is an index that describes the overall level of depletion applicable to the gas in any particular sight line, and the other two represent linear coefficients that describe how to derive each element's depletion from this sight-line parameter. The information from this study reveals the relative proportions of different elements that are incorporated into dust at different stages of grain growth. An extremely simple scheme is proposed for deriving the dust contents and metallicities of absorption-line systems that are seen in the spectra of distant quasars or the optical afterglows of gamma-ray bursts. Contrary to presently accepted thinking, the elements sulfur and krypton appear to show measurable changes in their depletions as the general levels of depletions of other elements increase, although more data are needed to ascertain whether or not these findings are truly compelling. Nitrogen appears to show no such increase. The incorporation of oxygen into solid form in the densest gas regions far exceeds the amounts that can take the form of silicates or metallic oxides; this conclusion is based on differential measurements of depletion and thus is unaffected by uncertainties in the solar abundance reference scale.},

From this information and the total abundances defined by the element fractions in young stars in the SMC, we construct a general interpretation on how these elements condense into solid form onto dust grains. As a group, the elements Si, S, Cr, Fe, Ni, and Zn exhibit depletion sequences similar to those in the local part of our Galaxy defined by Jenkins. The elements Mg and Ti deplete less rapidly in the SMC than in the Milky Way, and Mn depletes more rapidly. We speculate that these differences might be explained by the different chemical affinities to different existing grain substrates. For instance, there is evidence that the mass fractions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the SMC are significantly lower than those in the Milky Way. We propose that the depletion sequences that we observed for the SMC may provide a better model for interpreting the element abundances in low-metallicity Damped Lyman Alpha (DLA) and sub-DLA absorption systems that are recorded in the spectra of distant quasars and gamma-ray burst afterglows.},

For 16 of those sightlines, we also measure Si ii, Cr ii, and Zn ii from new Hubble Space Telescope Cosmic Origins Spectrograph observations. We analyze these spectra using a new spectral line analysis technique based on a semi-parametric Voigt profile model. We have combined these measurements with H i and H2 column densities and reference stellar abundances from the literature to derive gas-phase abundances, depletions, and gas-to-dust ratios (GDRs). Of our 84 P and 16 Zn measurements, 80 and 13, respectively, are depleted by more than 0.1 dex, suggesting that P and Zn abundances are not accurate metallicity indicators at and above the metallicity of the SMC. Si, Cr, and Fe are systematically less depleted in the SMC than in the Milky Way (MW) or LMC. The minimum Si depletion in the SMC is consistent with zero. We find GDR ranges of 190–565 in the LMC and 480–2100 in the SMC, which is broadly consistent with GDRs from the literature. These ranges represent actual location to location variation and are evidence of dust destruction and/or growth in the diffuse neutral phase of the interstellar medium. Where they overlap in metallicity, the gas-phase abundances of the MW, LMC, and SMC and damped Lyα systems evolve similarly with metallicity.},

To quantitatively examine the shape of the OB-star SED, we compare long slit observations of single-star, Large Magellanic Cloud H ii regions to the predictions from CLOUDY photoionization simulations that use CoStar, TLUSTY, and WM-basic stellar atmosphere models as the ionizing source. For each atmosphere model, we run grids of H ii region simulations with the effective temperature (Teff) of the star as a free parameter. The best SEDs from each atmosphere code are found by matching the predicted emission-line spectra with those observed from the nebulae. By assuming a clumpy gas distribution, all atmosphere codes are able to reproduce the observed emission lines, except at the highest energy transitions ≳ 40 eV. Taking into account both low and high energy transitions, we find that simulations using WM-basic produce the best agreement with the observed line ratios. The rates of ionizing photons from different atmosphere models vary systematically with the relative hardness of the SEDs. However, in general the rates produced by the model SEDs, for standard log(g) = 4.0 models, are consistent with the rates derived from the Hα luminosities. We find that our effective temperatures inferred from the nebular ionization balance are consistent with those predicted by conventional photospheric-based calibrations from the literature. We suggest that future spectral type to Teff calibrations can be constructed from nebular data.},

Physical conditions and chemical abundances were determined for three positions in NGC 456 and one position in NGC 460, first under the assumption of uniform temperature and then allowing for the possibility of thermal inhomogeneities. We determined t2 values based on three different methods: (1) by comparing the temperature derived using oxygen forbidden lines with the temperature derived using helium recombination lines (RLs), (2) by comparing the abundances derived from oxygen forbidden lines with those derived from oxygen RLs, and (3) by comparing the abundances derived from ultraviolet carbon forbidden lines with those derived from optical carbon RLs. The first two methods averaged t2 = 0.067 ± 0.013 for NGC 456 and t2 = 0.036 ± 0.027 for NGC 460. These values of t2 imply that when gaseous abundances are determined with collisionally excited lines they are underestimated by a factor of nearly two. From these objects and others in the literature, we find that in order to account for thermal inhomogeneities and dust depletion, the O/H ratio in low-metallicity H ii regions should be corrected by 0.25–0.45 dex depending on the thermal structure of the nebula or by 0.35 dex if such information is not available.},

A spatial analysis of 30 Doradus is performed, revealing that the forbidden-line [O iii] electron temperature is remarkably constant across the nebula. The forbidden-line O2+/H+ abundance mapped by the [O iii]λ4959 collisionally excited line (CEL) is shown to be consistently lower than the recombination-line abundance mapped by the O ii V1 multiplet at 4650 Å. In addition, the spatial profile of the C2+/O2+ ratio derived purely from recombination lines is presented for the first time for an extragalactic nebula. Temperature-insensitive ORL C2+/O2+ and N2+/O2+ ratios are obtained for all nebulae except SMC N66. The ORL C2+/O2+ ratios show remarkable agreement within each galactic system, while also being in agreement with the corresponding CEL ratios. The disagreement found between the ORL and CEL N2+/O2+ ratios for M 17 and NGC 3576 can be attributed to the N ii V3 and V5 ORLs that were used being affected by fluorescent excitation effects.For all five nebulae, the O2+/H+ abundance derived from multiple O ii ORLs is found to be higher than the corresponding value derived from the strong [O iii]λλ4959, 5007 CELs, by factors of 1.8 to 2.7 for four of the nebulae. The LMC N11B nebula exhibits a more extreme discrepancy factor for the O2+ ion, ∼5. Thus, these H ii regions exhibit ORL/CEL abundance discrepancy factors that are similar to those previously encountered amongst planetary nebulae.Our optical CEL O2+/H+ abundances agree to within 20–30 per cent with published O2+/H+ abundances that have been obtained from observations of infrared fine-structure lines. Since the low excitation energies of the latter make them insensitive to variations about typical nebular temperatures, fluctuations in temperature are ruled out as the cause of the observed ORL/CEL O2+ abundance discrepancies. We present evidence that the observed O ii ORLs from these H ii regions originate from gas of very similar density (\&lt;3500 cm−3) to that emitting the observed heavy-element optical and infrared CELs, ruling out models that employ high-density ionized inclusions in order to explain the abundance discrepancy. We consider a scenario whereby much of the heavy-element ORL emission originates from cold (≤500 K) metal-rich ionized regions. These might constitute haloes that are being evaporated from much denser neutral cores. The origin of these metal-rich inclusions is not clear — they may have been ejected into the nebula by evolved, massive Of and Wolf—Rayet stars, although the agreement found between heavy-element ion ratios derived from ORLs with the ratios derived from CELs provides no evidence for nuclear-processed material in the ORL-emitting regions.},

It is pointed out that, provided the bursts of star formation in the blue compact galaxies last much longer than the evolutionary time scale of a typical massive star, a minimum metal abundance close to that observed in I Zw 18 must be found in any H II region. This is due to the fact that the same massive stars produce both heavy elements and ionizing photons, while on short time scales mixing of newly formed heavy elements is confined to the H II region. Accordingly, emission line spectra cannot, in principle, give the true heavy element abundance in primordial systems.},

	abstract = {{\textless}i{\textgreater}Context. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}Low-metallicity star-forming dwarf galaxies are prime targets to understand the chemical enrichment of the interstellar medium. The H i region contains the bulk of the mass in blue compact dwarfs, and it provides important constraints on the dispersal and mixing of heavy elements released by successive star-formation episodes. The metallicity of the H i region is also a critical parameter to investigate the future star-formation history, as metals provide most of the gas cooling that will facilitate and sustain star formation. {\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}Our primary objective is to study the enrichment of the H i region and the interplay between star-formation history and metallicity evolution. Our secondary objective is to constrain the spatial- and time-scales over which the H i and H ii regions are enriched, and the mass range of stars responsible for the heavy element production. Finally, we aim to examine the gas heating and cooling mechanisms in the H i region. {\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}We observed the most metal-poor star-forming galaxy in the Local Universe, I Zw 18, with the Cosmic Origin Spectrograph onboard {\textless}i{\textgreater}Hubble{\textless}i/{\textgreater}. The abundances in the neutral gas are derived from far-ultraviolet absorption-lines (H i, C ii, C ii*, N i, O i, ...) and are compared to the abundances in the H ii region. Models are constructed to calculate the ionization structure and the thermal processes. We investigate the gas cooling in the H i region through physical diagnostics drawn from the fine-structure level of C{\textless}sup{\textgreater}+{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}. {\textless}i{\textgreater}Results. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}We find that H i region abundances are lower by a factor of {\textasciitilde}2 as compared to the H ii region. There is no differential depletion on dust between the H i and H ii region. Using sulfur as a metallicity tracer, we calculate a metallicity of 1/46 {\textless}i{\textgreater}Z{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} (vs. 1/31 {\textless}i{\textgreater}Z{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} in the H ii region). From the study of the C/O, [O/Fe], and N/O abundance ratios, we propose that C, N, O, and Fe are mainly produced in massive stars. We argue that the H i envelope may contain pockets of pristine gas with a metallicity essentially null. Finally, we derive the physical conditions in the H i region by investigating the C ii* absorption line. The cooling rate derived from C ii* is consistent with collisions with H{\textless}sup{\textgreater}0{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} atoms in the diffuse neutral gas. We calculate the star-formation rate from the C ii* cooling rate assuming that photoelectric effect on dust is the dominant gas heating mechanism. Our determination is in good agreement with the values in the literature if we assume a low dust-to-gas ratio ({\textasciitilde}2000 times lower than the Milky Way value).},

	abstract = {{\textless}i{\textgreater}Context. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}Evidence has grown over the past few years that the neutral phase of blue compact dwarf (BCD) galaxies may be metal-deficient as compared to the ionized gas of their H ii regions. These results have strong implications for our understanding of the chemical evolution of galaxies, and it is essential to strengthen the method, as well as to find possible explanations. {\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}We present the analysis of the interstellar spectrum of Pox 36 with the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer{\textless}i/{\textgreater} ({\textless}i{\textgreater}FUSE{\textless}i/{\textgreater}). Pox 36 was selected because of the relatively low foreground gas content that makes it possible to detect absorption-lines weak enough that unseen components should not be saturated.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}Interstellar lines of H i, N i, O i, Si ii, P ii, Ar i, and Fe ii are detected. Column densities are derived directly from the observed line profiles except for H i, whose lines are contaminated by stellar absorption, thus needing the stellar continuum to be removed. We used the TLUSTY models to remove the stellar continuum and isolate the interstellar component. The best fit indicates that the dominant stellar population is B0. The observed far-UV flux agrees with an equivalent number of {\textasciitilde}300 B0 stars. The fit of the interstellar H i line gives a column density of cm{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-2{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}. Chemical abundances were then computed from the column densities using the dominant ionization stage in the neutral gas. Our abundances are compared to those measured from emission-line spectra in the optical, probing the ionized gas of the H ii regions.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}Our results suggest that the neutral gas of Pox 36 is metal-deficient by a factor {\textasciitilde}7 as compared to the ionized gas, and they agree with a metallicity of {\textless}i{\textgreater}≈{\textless}i/{\textgreater}1/35 . Elemental depletion is not problematic because of the low dust content along the selected lines of sight. In contrast, the ionized gas shows a clear depletion pattern, with iron being strongly depleted. {\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}The abundance discontinuity between the neutral and ionized phases implies that most of the metals released by consecutive star-formation episodes mixes with the H i gas. The volume extent of the enrichment is so large that the metallicity of the neutral gas increases only slightly. The star-forming regions could be enriched only by a small fraction ({\textasciitilde}), but it would greatly enhance its metallicity. Our results are compared to those of other BCDs. We confirm the overall underabundance of metals in their neutral gas, with perhaps only the lowest metallicity BCDs showing no discontinuity.},

In addition, the abundance results for the Magellanic Clouds are compared with the sun, the Orion Nebula, and galactic planetary nebulae. In comparison with solar abundances, carbon is found to be depleted relative to hydrogen in the Magellanic Clouds by an amount larger than that of nitrogen and oxygen in the SMC and by an amount between that of nitrogen and oxygen in the LMC. It is noted that the results are consistent with a scenario that nitrogen and oxygen have greater primary yields in massive stars than carbon, which may be produced predominantly in less massive stars (such that C/N and C/O in galaxies are initially very low and subsequently increase with evolution). Subsequently, the C/N ratio may decrease as secondary production of nitrogen in less massive stars becomes significant.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the first consistent abundance analysis of both H II regions and supernova remnants in the Magellanic Clouds, as derived from detailed modeling of spectra extending from 3000 to 11000 A. The major purpose of the investigation was to find the zero-point error that might exist between the separated abundance scales derived from supergiants (from Russell and Bessell) and H II regions, and thereby determine the first consistent abundance scale from helium to the heaviest elements. An overlap between the two abundance scales was provided by the observation of supernova remnants. Detailed modeling of both the H II regions and the supernova remnants was performed using the same generalized modeling code MAPPINGS (Binette et al.), thus providing a consistent physical framework for both. For elements heavier than argon, however, a differential analysis was performed between the supernova remnants and the Galactic Herbig-Haro (H-H) objects. This shows that there is no measurable zero-point error between the abundance scales of the supergiants and the H II regions. This result is crucial and allows us, for the first time, to connect the two scales and thereby determine important details of the past star formation histories of both the Magellanic Clouds and the Galaxy. The most exciting result is that the elemental abundances relative to iron in the Clouds match those of the present local interstellar medium more closely than that of the Sun itself, thus suggesting a close similarity between the star formation histories of the Magellanic Clouds and of the local interstellar medium. Conversely, this indicates that the local interstellar medium of the Sun 4.5 x 10{\textasciicircum}9{\textasciicircum} yr ago had a substantially different history of star formation.},

	abstract = {This paper presents chemical and structural evolutionary models for the Magellanic Clouds assuming bimodal star formation and gas infall. The models are discussed in relation to the observed chemical abundances of the Clouds and are compared with our own Galaxy. The detailed abundances derived from previous work are investigated for any obvious trends with metallicity or differences compared with the Galaxy. Considering all the data, conclusions are drawn on the possible star formation histories of the Magellanic Clouds and the implications for our own Galaxy. The following conclusions were reached in this work. The interstellar medium (ISM) of the LMC has a mean metallicity 0.2 dex lower than the local Galactic ISM, and the metallicity of the SMC is 0.6 dex lower. However, the interstellar media of both the Magellanic Clouds and the Galaxy have significantly nonsolar elemental ratios. This is most evident when considering the lightest and the heaviest of the elements. The s-process appears to have been less effective at forming the heavy neutron- capture elements in the Magellanic Clouds than in the Galaxy. The r-process, on the other hand, appears to have been more effective. Of the light elements, carbon appears to be of normal abundance in the Cloud stars relative to the iron abundance, which is in contrast to the carbon abundances in the H II regions, which appear to be anomalously low. The overall distribution of the lightest elements in the Clouds shows a gradual falling off in the abundances, relative to the Sun, as the atomic number decreases. This is seen not to be the case when the abundances are compared with the local ISM, and suggests that the present ISM in the vicinity of the Sun is material that has fallen in from farther out.},
